# project-1-sidescroller
First project for GA. Initial plan is to make an infinite runner. If I am successful with that I will then attempt to make a plat former with either one or two levels. 


sooooo this project was pretty hard. Harder than I thought itd be. Really fun though

some problems I facesd were for the most part syntax errors and improperly implementing funtions or variable.

I started by doing a tutorial on phaser to understand how to use the directory. From there I implemented my own code found my own assets (kinda) and tried to make the game as fun as possible.

The goal of the game is to achieve the highest score you can by dodging obstacles and staying alive. Over Time the difficulty increases making it harder and harder to stay alive.

What I wanted but couldn't get:

I really wanted to add a life based sytem as well as a collection aspect which would give you more lives. Similiar to mario.

I had a really hard time getting the obstacles to generate randomly. After a certain amount of time I wanted everything to generate at random intervals and random speeds.

I couldn't get the fire physics to work properly. After a certain amout of time fire balls start falling from the back and are affected by gravity. But I couldn't get the collide physics between the fire and the ground to work as I wanted it to.

I really liked this project. It was a lot of fun and I think my game is a lot fun too.


To install git clone then using a server, sublime server is waht I used, open the index.html and play the game.
